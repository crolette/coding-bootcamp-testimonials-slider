## Overview

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard


## What I learned/developed specially for this challenge
- At first sight, the layout were not so difficult to make... until I had to do it. I needed 2 tries to make it. The first time I took "the mobile first" approach and I made it quite quickly, until I ran into the design for the desktop. After several hours I decided to stop, go to sleep and give it a new try. After a good night sleep, I took the project from zero again and it was quite clearer how to do it. For the second try, I decided to make the desktop layout first. As said, it seemed quite easy to make the text come over the picture but it was not (at least for a newbie), but it helped me to learn a lot. My way is probably not the best but it is quite similar to the given layout.
- Javascript : First time I had to create a slider. This was quite easy as I had a clear view on how to do it. So I created an array with objects to save the different elements of the testimonials (name, job, image source) and go throught this array depending on where the user click (previous/next).
